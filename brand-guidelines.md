## 6. Language and Tone

### 6.1 Voice Principles
We're approachable, friendly, lively and genuine. We communicate like real people and allow our personalities to shine through. We use natural, conversational language that shows we're human.

### 6.2 Word Choices
Prefer simple, clear language:
- Use **"start"** instead of "commence"
- Use **"let's talk"** instead of "please schedule a consultation"
- Use **"grab a copy"** instead of "download"
- Use **"we'll"** instead of "we will"

### 6.3 Setting the Right Tone

**❌ Too formal:**
"Jo Smith provides a demonstration of how to create a Power BI report in an efficient manner."

**✅ Just right:**
"Jo Smith shows us how to craft a quick Power BI report."

**❌ Overdoing it:**
"Everyone's fave engineer Jo Smith gives the lowdown on bossing an awesome Power BI report."

### 6.4 Language Dialect
We're based in London, United Kingdom. We cater for a global audience, and at the same time, we're proud of our British roots, so we:

#### Use British English Spellings
- Write **"categorise"** not "categorize"
- Write **"colour"** not "color"
- Write **"centre"** not "center"
- Write **"programme"** not "program" (except for computer programs)

#### Include Appropriate British Expressions
Mix in occasional British expressions that are both distinctly British and internationally understood:
- "spot on"
- "give us a shout"
- "cheers"
- "sorted"

### 6.5 Writing Style
We write in a friendly, engaging and confident way. Yes, we're professional, but not in a stuffy corporate way. We're human, lively and spirited. We're not afraid to be bold, sassy, playful and humorous. We're engaging and we write in a way that normal people can relate to.

### 6.6 Capitalisation Style (Sentence Case)
We use **sentence case** for all headings, titles, and buttons to maintain a modern, approachable style:

#### Use Sentence Case For:
- **Headings and titles**: "The true cost of technical debt" not "The True Cost of Technical Debt"
- **Button text**: "Process now" not "Process Now"
- **Navigation items**: "About us" not "About Us"
- **Form labels**: "Enter your email" not "Enter Your Email"
- **Menu items**: "View all products" not "View All Products"

#### Why Sentence Case?
- More conversational and friendly
- Easier to read
- Reflects modern design trends
- Consistent with our approachable brand personality

#### Examples:
- ✅ "Book your free consultation"
- ❌ "Book Your Free Consultation"
- ✅ "Download the complete guide"
- ❌ "Download The Complete Guide"

## 7. Application in Code and Documentation

### 7.1 Code Comments
Share a little bit of happiness with your fellow engineers by making code comments informative and human rather than dull and formal:
```csharp
// Let's grab the latest stock data from our supplier
// rather than: Retrieve inventory information from external source

// Sorted! We've successfully updated the product
// rather than: Product update operation completed successfully
```

### 7.2 User Interface Text
- Error messages should be helpful and human
- Success messages can be celebratory but professional
- Instructions should be clear and encouraging

### 7.3 Documentation
- Technical documentation should be clear but not dry
- Include examples that relate to real-world scenarios
- Use "we" and "you" to create a conversational tone

## 8. Brand Guidelines for Different Contexts

### 8.1 Client Communications
- Maintain professionalism whilst being approachable
- Use the client's language (avoid excessive jargon)
- Be solution-focused and positive

### 8.2 Internal Communications
- Can be more relaxed and playful
- Encourage team spirit and collaboration
- Celebrate successes enthusiastically

### 8.3 Marketing Materials
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use case studies and real examples
- Keep energy high and tone optimistic

### 8.4 Technical Documentation
- Balance accuracy with accessibility
- Use diagrams and examples liberally
- Don't assume prior knowledge

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid
