# Red Eagle Tech - Company information

## Overview

Red Eagle Tech was founded in 2024 to solve an important challenge: small and medium-sized businesses deserve the same quality of technology that enterprise organisations enjoy, but without the enterprise price tag or complexity.

The company's primary focus is **bespoke software development** - designing and building custom applications that solve the specific challenges each client faces. Whether it's automating manual processes, connecting systems that don't talk to each other, or building entirely new products, Red Eagle Tech creates software that fits each business like a glove.

Beyond software development, Red Eagle Tech offers supporting services that complete the picture: managed IT operations for businesses that need their technology looked after, and strategic technology governance for those who need expert guidance on their tech direction. Together, these services function as a "one-stop tech department" for SMEs who want enterprise-grade expertise without hiring an entire in-house team.

Based in the United Kingdom and serving clients across the UK and internationally, Red Eagle Tech combines deep technical expertise with an approachable, partnership-focused way of working.

## Core service: Bespoke software development

### What we build

Red Eagle Tech designs and develops custom software solutions tailored to each client's specific needs:

- **Web and mobile applications** - From internal tools to customer-facing products
- **AI and machine learning solutions** - Intelligent systems that learn and adapt
- **Business intelligence** - Power BI dashboards and interactive reports for data-driven decisions
- **System integrations** - Connecting the tools and platforms that businesses already rely on

### How we work

Let's address the elephant in the room: many business owners are understandably nervous about software projects. Horror stories of runaway budgets, missed deadlines, and software that doesn't quite do what was promised are all too common. "You'll know the final price when it's done" doesn't work for anyone running a business with real budget constraints.

That's why Red Eagle Tech leads with **fixed-price agile** - an approach that combines the budget certainty of traditional contracts with the flexibility and visibility of modern agile development.

#### Fixed-price agile

Here's how it works: Red Eagle Tech invests in thorough upfront discovery - understanding the business, documenting requirements, creating wireframes, and estimating effort. This discovery phase is typically a fixed-price engagement of its own, so clients know their investment before anything starts.

Based on that discovery, Red Eagle Tech provides a fixed-price proposal for the development work. The total cost is known upfront - no surprises, no open-ended hourly billing, no "it depends" answers.

Development then proceeds using agile methods - sprints, regular demos, continuous feedback. The clever bit? Clients can reprioritise features, swap things in and out - but they don't pay extra. If halfway through the project it becomes clear that Feature A is more important than Feature B, they can switch. The total cost stays the same; they just get the features that matter most.

Red Eagle Tech absorbs the risk of estimation, not the client. Changes to scope become conversations about priorities rather than negotiations about cost.

#### Rapid prototyping

Before writing production code, Red Eagle Tech creates interactive simulations of the software. Wireframes show page structure and navigation. Clickable prototypes let stakeholders walk through key workflows and test with real users.

This dramatically reduces the risk of building the wrong thing. Problems caught during prototyping cost a fraction to fix compared to problems discovered after development. Stakeholders can react to something tangible rather than abstract requirements, and misunderstandings surface when changes are cheap.

#### User Panel validation

Rather than building software in isolation and hoping users like it, Red Eagle Tech gathers continuous feedback from the people who will actually use the system through what they call the User Panel approach.

Real end-users react to prototypes before development begins, catching issues when changes are cheapest. Selected users test new features at the end of each sprint. Usability testing ensures workflows make sense to the target audience. User insights directly inform backlog prioritisation and guide development decisions.

This ensures the software works for the people who need to use it every day - not just the stakeholders who signed off on requirements.

#### Bi-weekly delivery

Red Eagle Tech works in two-week sprints, which means clients see working software every fortnight. Sprint planning happens on Day 1 - agreeing what gets built that sprint. Development proceeds with the team available for questions. Sprint review on Day 10 demos completed work and gathers feedback.

The typical client time commitment is around 3-5 hours per sprint. It's more than traditional waterfall approaches, but significantly less than full-time project management - and the results are dramatically better because the client is steering continuously.

## Supporting services

While bespoke software development is Red Eagle Tech's primary focus, many clients need broader technology support. Some need their systems managed and maintained. Others need strategic guidance before embarking on a development project. These supporting services complement the core software work and complete the "one-stop tech department" offering.

### IT operations

Many SMEs find themselves stretched thin managing their own technology infrastructure. Red Eagle Tech acts as an outsourced IT department, taking care of everything so clients can focus on running their business.

- Network management and security
- Cloud services and infrastructure
- Device management
- Helpdesk support for staff
- Proactive monitoring and maintenance

The approach is proactive rather than reactive - identifying and addressing potential issues before they become problems.

### Technology governance

For businesses without a full-time CTO or technology director, Red Eagle Tech provides strategic technology leadership to ensure technology investments align with business objectives.

- Virtual Chief Technology Officer (vCTO) services
- Compliance certification assistance
- Technology roadmap development
- Vendor selection and management support

This service is particularly valuable for businesses preparing for growth, navigating digital transformation, or ensuring their technology strategy supports their broader business goals.

## Products

Beyond client work, Red Eagle Tech has developed its own software products. **MeldEagle** is an e-commerce automation solution that emerged from the bespoke development practice - a real-world application of the methodology and technical expertise the company brings to client projects. MeldEagle has its own dedicated website and serves customers across multiple industries.

## Additional services

Red Eagle Tech provides professional training courses to help businesses and their teams enhance their technology skills. The **Power BI Masterclass** teaches businesses how to transform their data into compelling visual stories and actionable insights.

## Company values and approach

### Vision

Red Eagle Tech's vision is simple: **to be the most trusted tech partner that people love to work with**. Technology should be accessible, straightforward, and - dare we say it - enjoyable. The goal is to free clients to focus on what they do best: running their business.

### Brand promise

Everything Red Eagle Tech does comes back to three commitments:

**Giving enjoyable experiences** - Technology is for everyone. Red Eagle Tech makes it accessible, straightforward, and pleasant to work with.

**Building strong partnerships** - Rather than transactional vendor relationships, Red Eagle Tech aims to truly understand each client and partner with them to achieve their objectives.

**Delivering expertise** - The team is knowledgeable, stays up-to-date, and if they don't already know the answer, they'll find it.

### Core principles

Three principles guide every decision:

- **Security-first** - Client data and systems are protected in everything Red Eagle Tech builds
- **Human-centred** - Solutions are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, not just technically impressive
- **Business-driven** - Technology investments must deliver measurable results and contribute to the client's bottom line

### Brand personality

Red Eagle Tech is approachable and friendly - easy to work with and talk to. The team is trustworthy and reliable, delivering on promises. They work collaboratively with clients as partners rather than distant vendors. They're resourceful problem-solvers who find creative solutions to complex challenges. They bring deep expertise to every engagement, combined with genuine enthusiasm and energy for what they do.

## Target market

Red Eagle Tech primarily serves small and medium-sized businesses - organisations that have outgrown spreadsheets and off-the-shelf tools but aren't large enough to justify a full in-house development team. These are businesses that need enterprise-quality technology solutions but want a partner who understands their scale and speaks their language.

Clients come from across the UK and internationally, spanning various industries but sharing a common need: technology that actually works for their business, delivered by people they can trust.

## Operating model

Red Eagle Tech operates on a **remote-first** model. For clients, this means access to the best talent regardless of geography, cost-effective service delivery without expensive office overheads, and the flexibility to serve businesses across time zones.

For the team, it enables flexible working arrangements and draws from diverse talent pools. The result is a modern, efficient operation that puts client outcomes ahead of traditional ways of working.
