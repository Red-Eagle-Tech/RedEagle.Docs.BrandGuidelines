  # Logo files

  ## Which logo should I use?

  | Scenario | Recommended file |
  |----------|------------------|
  | Website, light backgrounds | `svg/ret-logo-landscape-dark.svg` |
  | Dark backgrounds, overlays | `svg/ret-logo-landscape-light.svg` or files in `square-white/` |
  | Print materials | SVG files (scalable) or high-res PNGs |
  | Social media, thumbnails | Square logos in `png/square-standard/` |
  | Wide/banner formats | Landscape logos in `png/landscape-standard/` |

  ## Formats available

  - **SVG** – Scalable vectors, ideal for web and print
  - **PNG** – Raster images at various sizes, transparent backgrounds
  - **WebP** – Mascot image for web use

  ## Basic rules

  - Maintain clear space around the logo
  - Don't stretch, rotate, or alter the logo
  - Don't change the colours
  - Don't place the dark logo on dark backgrounds (use the white version)
